# AI Librarian , your one stop app to make reading fun and intuitive ![Untitled design](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b2c4a65-a91c-48fc-baa1-078a9993a263)

## How to use the App ?

1. Make sure the server is hosted in a Local Area Net!
   work or something similar to that
2. The app is saved as a ""universal.apk" file  which is in apk folder
3. download it and run the app , and it should work.

## Things you can do with the app:

1. All your books and pdfs are stored in the 'Bookstack' section of the app, for ease to read.
2. Wednesday AI , your personal Librarian who knows everything there is to , related to books
3. a profile page for more customisation options to more personalised Wednesday.

## Tech Stack :

* Server:
  1. Fast api
  2. Langchain
  3. Ollama
  4. Sqlite3 and Chromadb for database and vector database storage
* App:
  * Flutter
  * Dashchat2
  * pdfx

## Bugs:

There are some known Bugs which i am working on to fix in future iterations of the app:

1. The app needs to rerun in order to load all the images in bookstack
2. when navigating through navbar your previous chats with Wednesday gets removed.
3. sometimes Wednesday behaves abit wonky , restarting the fastapi server usually fixes that problem

## Plans for the future Iterantions of the app:

1. You can upload books from the app to the api and API will handle the rest.
2. More Extensive implementation of 'Profile' as of now it's a concept page , and i want to integrate it with wednesday for a more customised expirience
3. More options in the pdf reader of the app.
4. More Functionality provieded by Wednesday , right now , she can summarize books and clear concepts of the books.
5. Search bar in the App , to search for books you want to read
6. a recommendations system , powered by Wednesday !
